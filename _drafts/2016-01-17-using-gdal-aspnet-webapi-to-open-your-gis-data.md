In this adventure, we'll build together a REST API with ASP.NET and GDAL ogr2ogr to liberate
your data in many formats without too much coding.

What I seek to achieve:

- An api fun to use and easy to work with.
- An ability to rename fields or specialize them depending on the formats
- Supporting open formats:
  - geojson for the web
  - gml for the ministries
  - csv for open-data enthousiasts

Future post on GDAL and ASP.NET Web API to build a rest endpoint liberating your data in multiple formats.
