The best teachers I had were all remarkably good at what they did. They could explain any problem in simple terms making any subject accessible. They kept me interested, challenged me just enough and kept me in a state eager to learn. The path to success was clear and easy to follow.  I did learn and still learn everyday. I did practice and I think I'm great at what I do. Omitting the teaching part, I've done the loop many times, but everytime I try to teach, oh boy...

I kept thinking about what my teachers did to be great at teaching to find what I constantly fail to do. They had the passion and the people skills, but I think their real specialty was their ability to adapt the conversation to a level I could comprehend.

In computer-related terms (I'm that type of guy after all), **they abstracted to the level of their targetted audience**. It is a skill I find difficult to master and it explains why only fellows with similar career paths can normally understand me.

This blog addresses my weakest link: teaching.  It is my first attempt at such things it will not be pretty, but as I'm always thriving to be better, we'll see how that goes.

Stay tuned !
