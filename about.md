I'm Martin Richard. I currently work at [Laval][laval], the third biggest municipality of Qu√©bec, Canada. My favorite hobby is to challenge status quo, propose new ideas and shake the virtual landscape of our beautiful city. Since it's only a hobby and bills must be paid, I'm also a software architect in [geomatic][geodef].

This blog is an extension of my career, borrowing from giants and adapting free and open-sourced technology at a municipal level.  You will also see glimpses of proprietary tech and how to use them to free you instead of locking yourself in.

Stay tuned !
