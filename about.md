I'm Martin Richard. I currently work at [Laval][laval], the third biggest municipality of Qu√©bec, Canada.  As a software architect in the [geomatic][geodef] division, my main job is to challenge status quo, propose new ideas and shake the virtual landscape of our beautiful city.

This blog is an extension of my career, borrowing from giants and adapting free and open-sourced technology at a municipal level.  You will also see glimpses of proprietary tech and how to use them to free you instead of walling yourself in.

Stay tuned !
